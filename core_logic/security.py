# This module is for handling all cryptographic and security-related tasks.

# In a real-world scenario, this module would contain functions for:
# - Tokenizing sensitive card data
# - Encrypting/decrypting messages
# - Hashing data for integrity checks

    """Simulates tokenizing card data."""
    # This is a placeholder. You would integrate with a secure tokenization service here.
